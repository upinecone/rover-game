ü™ê Rover Rumble: Mars Tactics
A 2D Turn-Based Tactical Combat Simulator

1. Objective
The goal of Rover Rumble is simple: be the last operational rover on the Martian surface. You control the Phoenix rover, and you must use movement, energy management, and weapons effectively to destroy the enemy rover, Viper.

2. Rover Management & Status
Each rover has several key stats that you must manage during combat:

Stat

Max Value

Regeneration/Penalty

Description

HP (Health Points)

50



When HP reaches 0, the rover is destroyed.

MP (Movement Points)

3

-

MP is spent on moving across the grid. Cost depends on terrain.

Energy (E)

10

Fully regenerates each turn.

Energy is required to activate modules (weapons and utilities).

Heat (H)

10

Cools by 2 each turn.

Generated by using modules. Reaching max Heat triggers Overheat.

Overheat Penalty
If a rover's Heat reaches 10, it immediately begins Overheating. On its next turn, it suffers a penalty of -2 MP, severely limiting movement, and must prioritize cooling down.

3. Modules (Actions)
Rovers use modules, which are activated with Energy and generate Heat.

5. How to Play (Controls)
The game is strictly turn-based: you act, then the AI acts.

Your Turn (Phoenix): The grid will highlight all possible cells you can reach with your remaining MP (Movement Points), considering terrain costs.

Movement: Click on any highlighted (orange-bordered) cell to move your rover. Movement is calculated using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to ensure accuracy across variable terrain costs. You can move multiple times until your MP runs out.

Actions (Modules):

Click a Module Button (e.g., "Laser Cannon") in the Actions panel. The button will turn orange, indicating it is selected.

If it's a weapon, click the target (Viper). If it's a self-utility, the action is used immediately.

Using a module costs Energy and generates Heat.

Ending Turn: When you are finished with your actions, click the "End Turn" button to pass control to the AI.

AI Turn (Viper): The AI will decide whether to attack you (if in range and enough Energy) or move closer.
